For this assignment, I modeled and animated a canoe and paddles in Blender.

Design Process:
I modeled the canoe and paddles separately, referencing real-life measurements to make sure the scale was correct. I did not detail the canoe as much because it was not going to be animated. The detailing went into the paddles, making sure that they were shaped and sized correctly to be animated.

Animation Process:
The animation was all on the paddles. I animated them in a rowing motion to simulate paddling through water. I used keyframes to move and rotate the paddles along a natural curve, taking them slightly out of the water at the end of each stroke. I made sure to use smooth interpolation between keyframes to give a steady realistic movement.
The canoe itself remained still, offering a solid base while the paddles did all the moving.

Challenges and What I Learned:
A challenge was how to create the paddle movement convincingly without actually moving the canoe itself. Timing and angle of each stroke made a big difference. I found that even when only part of a scene is being animated, the movement still needs to somehow feel connected to the environment to be convincing.

This exercise permitted me to practice keeping simple animations in check while keeping a definite emphasis on the main action.
